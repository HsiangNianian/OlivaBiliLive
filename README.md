# 📢Plugin Maintenance Notice

Due to the lack of updates and maintenance over an extended period of time, there may be various big and small issues with using this plugin.

## ⏫Upgrade OlivOS

To continue using the `OlivaBiliLive` plugin directly on `OlivOS`, I recommend upgrading `OlivOS` to the latest version and choosing to login with the Bilibili Danmaku protocol.

## ✨Plugin Support

Yes this plugin still provides native support and allows you to write various interesting plugins.

## 🐱‍🚀Join Group Chat

If you wish to continue using this plugin, you can join our group chat (Group ID: 971050440) and provide more detailed information. I will make efforts to fix it in my free time.
